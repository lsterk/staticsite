# Merry Christmas!

2025 was such a FULL year! So much happened, in fact, that we are not even going to attempt to summarize the year chronologically. Instead, as an introduction to our 2025 letter, we have crafted a year in review that was inspired by our card design and is, loosely, set to the tune of “12 Days of Christmas." 

**Rae and Landon’s Twelve Months of 2025**

In the twelve months of 2025, 
My true love enjoyed with me:

TWELVE months of Landon’s freshly baked bread  
ELEVEN-ish barre classes Rae taught each month  
TEN great trips and visits from our family and best friends  
  (especially this summer,  
  when you could find us in  
  San Diego, Irvine, Bar Harbor, Lynden, and Seattle)  
NINE-ty year celebrations  
EIGHT batches of homemade yogurt  
SEVEN Gernants/Sterks in Chicago  
(where we enjoyed Cubs games, Wait, Wait Don’t Tell Me live, and Kyra & Alec’s wedding)  
SIX live plays or musicals  
FIVE times ten books and counting  
(but more if you count Landon’s)  
FIVE years of marriage  
FIVE years in our condo  
FOUR new countries visited  
Except only THREE for Landon  
  (because he pointed out he’s already been to Austria)  
TWO 30th birthdays  
and A lovely, long-awaited kitchen renovation   
  *\*insert piano flourish and final cord here\**


In the rest of our letter, you can read all about our two international trips, kitchen renovation, and Rae’s book recommendations. We also have a “Year in Pictures” section at the end as a reward for reading the whole letter (just kidding, feel free to skip to it!). As for all the other fun alluded to above, we’d love to catch up if you want the full scoop for everything we did.

## April in Europe - Tulips and More!

Our first big trip of the year was a Spring Break tour in Europe, with stops in Amsterdam, Prague and Vienna. Last Christmas, we pitched the idea to Rae's family, and her parents joined us for the trek! We met up in Amsterdam, where we enjoyed walks along canals and cobblestone streets, visits to art museums, and a glorious performance of St Matthew's Passion the night before Easter. We also enjoyed a fabulous walk through the Keukenhof tulip garden, where we accomplished Rae's dream of seeing spring tulips in bloom. Landon was enthused to visit Delft, a city known for manufacturing blue and white porcelain, so we finally have some Dutch-style pottery in our house.

Next, we flew to Prague to visit Lukas, who lived with the Gernant family in Iowa for a year during Rae's first year in college. Lukas showed us some of his favorite spots in the city and brought us to see postcard-worthy spots both on the tourist lists and local secrets. It was an incredible treat to have an architecture and urban planning expert as our guide to the city. We had so much fun with Lukas, and learned so much about Czech history and the fascinating stories of Prague's evolution over time.

We said goodbye to Lukas and Prague, and took a cozy train ride to Vienna through the beautiful Czech and Austrian countryside. Vienna's old city was charming, with cozy cafes for coffee and a towering cathedral over it all. Rainy weather sent us inside for most of the time, but we explored the Schӧnbrunn palace and took a self-guided street car tour of the city center! Food was the wurst (!) part - traditional Austrian fair offered many cozy dishes for the cold weather, and warm Apfelstrudel was an easy hit. On our last night in Europe, Landon and Rae attended a performance of Mozart's Magic Flute opera at the historic Vienna State Opera House; the only tickets available were in the standing-room "stehplatze", but seeing the inside of the opera house alone made standing all night worth it! Although we were exhausted by the finale, it was the perfect end to a whirlwind tour of April in Europe.

## Iceland
In addition to seeing the tulips at Keukenhoff, Rae has dreamed of getting to see the Northern Lights. Once again having the week of Thanksgiving off for Rae’s work, we planned a trip to Iceland. Although it would be a quick trip to also try and make it home for Thanksgiving day, Iceland offered the perfect mix of moderate winter weather and relaxing activities to fill the short winter days. 

On the first two nights, we had beautiful, starry, clear skies but no Northern Lights. We tried not to be too disappointed and crossed our fingers for the rest of our stay. On the third night, Landon woke Rae up around 1am and we shivered on the deck getting some nice pictures. We couldn’t see the lights with our eyes, but they were there! On our final night, the skies were cloudy and a multi-day snow storm had started. But around 3am, Landon woke up and saw the lights actually dancing across the sky before they hid back behind the clouds.

Besides watching the auroras dance above our cabin, the highlights of our trip were:
- Exploring ice caves on a glacier (Katla Geopark / Mýrdalsjökull glacier)
- Going to a geothermal lagoon spa with a beautiful, sunset view 
- Seeing majestic Icelandic waterfalls and geysers (Gullfoss / Geysir)
- Exploring Icelandic cuisine (including a food tour walk in Reykjavik)
