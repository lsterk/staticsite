# Merry Christmas from Landon and Rae!



We're grateful for a year filled with many beautiful moments. There are so many photos we wanted to share to tell you what did in 2025 - we hope you enjoy a little bit more detail of our year!

## April in Europe - Tulips and More!

In April, we traveled across Europe with Rae's parents for a spring break. We met in Amsterdam, and enjoyed time walking along canals, visiting museums, and acclimating to vacation time.

One of the highlights for all of us was visiting the tulip fields in Keukenhof near Amsterdam:
